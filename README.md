# Log Parser Challenge

-  This project was carried out using the Ruby language, version 3.1.0.
-  The goal of this project is to build a parser for the games.log file. 
-  The first task was to load this file and to print of its first line adding an automated test to understand if the reading was behaving as expected. Also, another test was added to handle the error if the file did not exist. 

## Installing Ruby

There are several ways to install Ruby: 
 - When you're on a UNIX-based operating system, using your system's package management system is the easiest way to get started. However, usually the packaged version of Ruby is not the latest.
Installers can be used to install a specific version of Ruby or even several of them. There is also an installer for Windows.
- Managers help you switch between multiple Ruby installations on your system.
- And finally, you can also compile Ruby from source code.
